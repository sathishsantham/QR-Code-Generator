QR Code Generator – Project Description 

The QR Code Generator is a simple and interactive web application that lets users instantly create QR codes from any text or URL they enter. It’s built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the main goal is to make QR code generation quick and easy for anyone, without needing to install any tools or software.

The interface is clean and easy to use. At the top, there's a clear header that introduces the tool, followed by a text input box where users can type or paste a URL or any other text. Once they click the "Generate QR Code" button, the app instantly shows a scannable QR code based on the input.

Behind the scenes, JavaScript handles the functionality. When the user clicks the button, the script sends a request to an external QR code API, which generates the image. The app also listens for user input changes, so if the field is empty or the same text is entered again, it avoids making unnecessary API calls. This makes the app both efficient and responsive.

Overall, this project was a great way to explore JavaScript event handling, API integration, and real-time UI updates. It’s a useful tool for anyone who wants to quickly create QR codes for links, contact details, or any text-based info — all from a browser.
